## Description

The Challenge for Module #12 asked us to create a database that could be accessed and rendered through the terminal, based on various criteria. We were to query the database to display all departments, all roles, and all employees. Additionally, we needed to be able to add a department, add a role, add an employee, and update an employee's role within the company.

## Usage

To use this app, clone the app files into your favorite code editor. Right click index.js, and select Open in Integrated Terminal (or similar command based on your editor). Type <i> npm run start </i> in the terminal and press return. Use your arrows to navigate through the list of available options and click return to make your selection. To add a role, department, employee, or to update an employee, answer the question prompts, pressing return after each one. If you view all departments, roles, or employees, your addition will appear.


## Challenges

Syntax was a big challenge in this one-- MySQL is very specific about what does and does not work. Making sure all ids/column names/formulae were all named consistently and working together took quite a lot of time as well.
